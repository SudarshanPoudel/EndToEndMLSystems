# End-to-End AI Systems

This repository contains code and examples used in my **End-to-End AI Systems** article series on Medium.

The goal of this repo is not to provide a polished framework, but to share **practical, minimal, and runnable examples** that demonstrate how real-world AI systems are built—covering data ingestion, streaming, feature pipelines, training workflows, and system design concepts.

Each folder corresponds to a specific article or concept discussed in the series.
